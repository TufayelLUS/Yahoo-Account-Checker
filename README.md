# What do I learn by developing it?
Going through the development process of this software, helped me to practice different Python libraries and GUI application development. I have implemented threading, proxy integration, a web scraping library named <b>requests</b>, a GUI development library named <b>tkinter</b>, and, regular expression to parse and extract the required data using <b>re</b> library to prepare this software. I hope you will like it.
